### Description

(*Describe the session in one paragraph; 500 words max.*)

Science is about the discovery and sharing of information, but much of
the process is often shrouded in mystery. The seemingly endless
competition for limited research funding has led to notions that
“knowledge is power” and “control is critical”, which can hinder the
exploration of new ideas or methodologies. Furthermore, we are also
witnessing an increase in journal retractions and scientists’ inability
to successfully reproduce previous findings. Fortunately, however, there
is a growing movement among scientists to embrace newer technological
developments that allow for more transparent design, execution,
analysis, and dissemination of research.

This session will highlight a variety of examples of tools and best
practices in the open science process, including data management,
reproducible workflows, and options for collaboration and dissemination
of results.
